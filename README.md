# Credit Risk Prediction

#### Problem Background:

The lending of loans to applicants labeled as "bad risk" constitutes the most significant financial loss to the lending company. Credit loss refers to the monetary loss incurred by the company when the applicant fails to repay the loan or absconds with the borrowed amount.

#### Objectives:

1. To prevent the risk of default, the objective is to detect patterns that suggest an applicant may not repay the loan or be classified as a bad risk. This information can be used to make decisions such as rejecting the loan application, reducing the loan amount, or lending at a higher interest rate. By identifying these patterns, the lending company can minimize potential losses and make informed decisions to improve profitability.
2. Implement a machine learning model that accurately predicts the risk status of loan applicants.
